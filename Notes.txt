Learned the basics of factory and faker methods.

These are the commands used in Tinker for generating random users:

o 1st Command

App\Models\User::factory()->create(); // Create a single random user

o 2nd Command

App\Models\User::factory(3)->create(); // Create three random users

o 3rd Command

App\Models\User::factory(3)->unverified->create(); // Create three random users with unverified email status

o 4th Command

App\Models\User::factory()->admin->create(); // Create a random user with admin privilege

o 5th Command

App\Models\Post::factory(50)->create(); // Create fifty random posts

Added a method to assign a user as admin in the user factory file.

Added a 'is_admin' column to the user table migration.

Changed value of 'APP_FAKER_LOCALE' from 'en_US' to 'id_ID'.

Created a factory for 'Posts'.
