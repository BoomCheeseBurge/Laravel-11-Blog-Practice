Added show/hide column, display per page, and column resize functionalities.

Added sort column functionality to dashboard posts and admin category tables.

Added search functionality to dashboard posts and admin category tables.

________________________________________________________________

Modified search query to be more flexible without basing off a single column for dashboard posts, admin posts, and admin categories.

________________________________________________________________

Included author column based on username for the admin posts.

________________________________________________________________

Added a custom validation rule for search keywords.

However, Eloquent methods already ensures that any variables passed in the parameters are escaped through the use of PDO parameter binding.

An issue with the 'search' custom validation rule used in the Livewire component.

The error message shown is 'Call to a member function with() on null'.

Based on forum answers, the error message is due to the custom validation rule causing a conflict with Livewire.

The reason is because the custom validation rule will return an error message (if any) using the session's 'with()' method which does not exist in Livewire.

This has been verified in the project here as well.

Hence, the validation rule is performed directly on the Livewire component without using Laravels validation method nor the separate validation rule.

________________________________________________________________

Fixed search functionality where GET request does not need CSRF protection since no data is posted.

The consequence of including this will cause the CSRF token to be included in the URL parameter.
