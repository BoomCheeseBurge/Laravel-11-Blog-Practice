Installed Flowbite into the project.

Since the 'taiwindcss', 'postcss', and 'autoprefixer' packages were already installed previously, only the flowbite is needed to be installed.

npm install -D flowbite

Additionally, the vite import was replaced from '@vite('resources/css/app.css')' to '@vite(['resources/css/app.css','resources/js/app.js'])'.

The 'Default blog card' component from the 'Blog Sections' section is used from the Flowbite, open-source Tailwind component library.

Added a new field called 'color' to the categories table.

Since Tailwind does not recognize variable values when used with utility classes, the utility classes must be specified in the Tailwind configuration file.
In other words, Tailwind does not recognize dynamic utility classes.

To avoid having to write the whole utility class names, a method using safe-list from Tailwind can be used.

The 'Default blog template' component from the 'Blog Template' section is used from Flowbite, open-source Tailwind component library.

The Flowbite typography package is installed.
