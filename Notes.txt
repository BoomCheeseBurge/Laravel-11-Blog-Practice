Created a foreign key constraint between the user and post in the post migration.

Create a relation between the user and post in the factory by creating fake users while generating the posts (See the post factory).

The command used in Tinker:

o 1st Command

App\Models\Post::factory(50)->recycle(App\Models\User::factory(5)->create())->create(); // Create five users where each user will have different portion from a total of a hundred posts

Created a model relationship between user and post.

With this model relationship, the referenced model can be accessed through the model relationship name as follows:

- See a post is written by which author

    $post = App\Models\Post::first();

    $post->author->name;

- See a user has written which posts

    $user = App\Models\User::first();

    $user->posts;

It is also mentioned or an added parameter is given in the User model relationship that the foreign key in the posts table is 'author_id' instead of 'user_id' by default based on the table's name.

Created a view for displaying a list of posts written by a single user.
