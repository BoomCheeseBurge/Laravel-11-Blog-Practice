SQLite is a file based database that does not rely on a database server.

If the SQLite database file is accidentally deleted, then just run the migration command again and it will ask to create a new SQLite database file based on the migration files.

Added migration for a 'posts' table.

Added two rows of dummy data to the 'posts' table directly in TablePlus.
