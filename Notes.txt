Created a resource based admin user controller.

Created the necessary views for the controller.

________________________________________________________________

Uninstalled NPM Tailwind package because Laravel 11.X already has Tailwind installed in its core by default.

If the Tailwind package is kept installed, then there can be conflicts and issues where utility classes may not work properly.

Ex: Using grid and specifying grid-cols-[n] may cause some n-column to not work

________________________________________________________________

Create a create user view and its associated controller method.

________________________________________________________________

Added a custom rule for checking maximum characters of an input.

________________________________________________________________

Added 'profile_pic', 'profile_cover', and 'about' fields to the User model.

________________________________________________________________

Added soft delete to the User model.

________________________________________________________________

Added 'users.destroy' to the 'ziggy.php' file to utilize the route helper method in JS.

________________________________________________________________

Merged 'dashboard-table' into the 'default-table' file.

________________________________________________________________

When sending a trashed model to the route, then the 'withTrashed()' method must be chained to the route.

________________________________________________________________

Move the horizontal scrollbar to be specifically on the table excluding the pagination.
