Tailwind CSS is installed into the project.

TailwindUI is utilized for its stacked layout.

Additionally, TailwindUI has its own font that is imported as well (which can be seen at the 'Optional: Add the Inter font family' section of the documentation).

The TailwindUI components usually has a comment above its component code that informs what part of the HTML document needs to be modified.

Since the TailwindUI components require JS to work properly, the documentation suggests AlpineJS as one of the solutions for this problem.

AlpineJS is installed into the project.

AlpineJS requires a bundler to be installed. The video for this can be seen in the video playlist folder.

Added the required AlpineJS attributes indicated by the comments of the TailwindUI component to enable interactivity.
