Created a dashboard post create page.

Installed the Laravel sluggable package by Colin Viebrock from GitHub.

Added a create post button on the dashboard posts page.

Any custom methods outside of the default resource constroller methods must be placed before the resource constroller route.

Installed Ziggy package by Tighten to be able to use route helper in JS script.

Added an automatic slugged post title from the title field to the slug field.

Added a CDN for Trix Editor package for post content input.

Disabled and hid the file upload on the Trix Editor input toolbar.

The method to hide the file upload button on the Trix editor's toolbar can be either be done through CSS or JS, but CSS seems to be more effective (try using JS and see why).

The placeholder's color on the Trix Editor input cannot be changed.

The button icon's color on the Trix Editor toolbar cannot be changed.

The upload link button on Trix editor's toolbar may still be visible on certain page loads for some reason.

Fixed the single post page where it shows escaped characters for the post body content.

Fixed the table number to follow through on the next pages.

Featured image upload in the post form is not yet implemented.
