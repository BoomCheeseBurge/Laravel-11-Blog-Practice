Followed the pagination setup from the Laravel documentation.

The pagination directory is published for further customization.

A problem is shown when using the pagination in a search query or with a certain category or author. The URI parameter will not be brought over with the pagination with the default pagination query.

In that case, the solution is to include the query parameter in the query.
