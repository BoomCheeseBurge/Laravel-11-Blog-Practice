Added form request classes for storing and updating posts, categories, and users.

________________________________________________________________

Created a modular form request rules for posts and users.

There is an abstract form request class for each model that has a trait containing the base rules for the inherited form request classes.

The inherited form request classes can then inherit that abstract class and extend the rules in its own rules() method.

Created a trait for uploading image files.

Apparently, the default User model brought by a fresh Laravel installation has type casting set unto email_verified_at and password.

In other words, every time the password has been validated, it will be automatically hashed afterwards before being saved into the database.

Hence, there is "technically" no need to hash the password in the controller.
