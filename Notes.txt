The way it works is that, in PHP, casting a variable to a boolean using (bool) will result in true if the variable is non-zero, and false otherwise. When used in arithmetic operations, true is treated as 1 and false as 0. So, multiplying the optional variables by their boolean equivalents ensures that they are only added to the final result if they are non-zero.
