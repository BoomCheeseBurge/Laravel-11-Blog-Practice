Notice how previously, the factories were still executed in Tinker. That was a tedious task to do of going into Tinker and then running the factories.

The solution is to use database seeder to automate this process.

Moreover, the seeding process can be done after migrations.

Seeder can be used alone, or it can be used with factories in which the fake data is created first before being harvested by the seeder.

The following command is used to reset migrations and then run the seeder:

php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

A separate manually generated user can be included in the generation of other factories by including it in the recycle method.

A User and Catergory seeders were created.

With seeders, the seeders will be called first, and then, the related models of the seeders will be called in the recycle method.
